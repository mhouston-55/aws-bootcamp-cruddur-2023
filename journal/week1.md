# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
1. Wrapped up Week 0 accoutns that I missed
2. Tried to spin up Gitpod and DOcker Compose up Cruddr before watching the Week 1 Homework video, ran into errors as I had to re-run npm -i (Which Andrew showed in the video). 
3. This led me to dive into persistence of python libraries for Flask, and the nmp -i libraries and why it didn't save. I came across some posts where the only data that gets saved is within /workspaces and with pip install it could download beyond that .workspaces. This seems like a rabbithole I could come back to.
4. Setup the frontend and backend notifications per the video but definitely struggled, I have not done any front end/back end work with React and Flask. More homework to come back to.
5. Also studying IAM accounts/Roles in particular and wondering how we are going to implement them for this project without looking too far ahead in the curriculum.
